  <p> Blinded at the age of by explosive near some old <b>railroad tracks,</b>
    <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-weird-and-true-story-of-moondog/"> Louis Thomas Hardin </a>
    walked the streets of West 54th Street and 6th Avenue in downtown Manahatten performing his poetry and self-made percussion.
    Most people mistook his genius and peaceful protest as a homeless person, or someone with severe mental illess, 
    unaware the accalimed American Composer had much more to him than what meets the eye.
    Quite the contrary, this musical and sensitive genius spent years from the 1940's on dressing as a Viking (to deter the claims he resembled
    <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/03/28/moondog-musician-history/">Jesus.)</a> 
    Hardin changed his name in 1947, officially, to Moondog.  He credited his unique rhythmic approach to childhood experiences with the Arapaho Tribe in Wyoming, 
      where he grew up. This is where he learned the syncopation of their Sun Dances and often stated "they had more swing than Jazz."
